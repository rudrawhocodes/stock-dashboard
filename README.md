Stock Dashboard

This is a personal project I built to explore financial data visualization and technical analysis. It’s a stock market dashboard made with Python, Streamlit, and Plotly, where you can chart stocks, add indicators, and even compare multiple tickers at once.

As a CS & Math undergraduate interested in quantitative finance, I wanted to learn how to fetch live market data, process it, and build an interactive tool that looks and feels close to real trading dashboards.

What it can do

Candlestick or Line Charts – switch between two charting modes.

Bollinger Bands – see volatility trends directly on the chart.

Multi-Stock Comparison – plot two or more stocks on the same graph to see how they move relative to each other.

Ticker Search & Dropdown – no need to memorize symbols, just pick from a list or search.

Custom Date Ranges – choose your own analysis window.

Data Table – inspect the actual stock price data.

Why I built this

I wanted hands-on experience with:

Using APIs like yFinance to pull market data.

Working with Pandas for financial time series.

Creating interactive dashboards in Streamlit.

Understanding how real-world charting tools (like TradingView) are built.

Next steps

Some things I’d like to add in the future:

More indicators like RSI, MACD, and moving averages.

A portfolio tracker to see PnL and benchmark comparisons.

Real-time price updates.
